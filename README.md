# CapaCiTi-Sprint1-Python-Fundamentals-
During my time at CapaCiTi, we were working on a LMS, where we would do a Sprint every week. The first sprint was a button counter which showed the amount of times a button was clicked, and a math-based calculator. This was done using Python, which was learned from Python Fundamentals.
